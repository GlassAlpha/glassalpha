  - Confidence interval data exported in JSON format for programmatic access
  - CLI: All fairness metrics now include 95% confidence intervals by default

  - Test coverage: 21 comprehensive tests validating determinism, accuracy, and edge cases

### Changed

- **Config Schema**: Added `data.intersections` field for E5.1 intersectional fairness analysis
  - Validates intersection format: must be `"attr1*attr2"` for two-way intersections
  - Normalizes to lowercase and strips whitespace
  - Example: `intersections: ["gender*race", "age_years*foreign_worker"]`
- **Fairness Metrics Runner**: Enhanced to compute bootstrap CIs, sample size warnings, power analysis, and intersectional metrics
  - New parameter: `intersections` list for specifying intersectional analysis
  - Automatically computes intersectional fairness when intersections specified
  - Results nested under `intersectional` key in output
- **Audit Pipeline**:
  - Now passes seed to fairness runner for deterministic confidence intervals
  - Now passes intersections config to fairness runner for E5.1 analysis
  - Now computes E11 individual fairness metrics alongside group fairness
  - Passes full feature DataFrame to fairness metrics for individual-level analysis
- **AuditResults**: Fairness analysis now includes `sample_size_warnings`, `statistical_power`, `{metric}_ci`, and `individual_fairness` keys
- **`_compute_fairness_metrics()`**: Signature updated to accept full feature DataFrame for individual fairness computation

### Fixed

- None

### Performance

- Bootstrap CIs add ~2-3 seconds per fairness metric (with n_bootstrap=1000, n=200)
- No memory overhead (bootstrap samples not retained)
- Determinism has zero performance cost (uses existing seeding infrastructure)

### Security

- None

### Deprecated

- None

### Removed

- None
