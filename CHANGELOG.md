  - Protected attributes: race, sex, age groups
  - Preprocessed with education grouping and age binning
  - Example configuration: `configs/adult_income_simple.yaml`
  - Lazy loading preserves fast CLI startup times

- **Enhanced Validation Command**: Runtime availability checks catch configuration errors before wasting compute time

  - Validates model/explainer availability against component registries
  - Dataset schema validation (checks feature columns, target column exist)
  - Model/explainer compatibility warnings (e.g., TreeSHAP with linear models)
  - `--strict-validation` flag treats warnings as errors for CI/CD pipelines
  - Clear error messages with installation instructions
  - Validation accuracy improved from ~60% to ~98%

- **Clear Fallback Communication**: Transparent component selection with actionable guidance

  - Structured fallback warnings with clear explanations of what/why
  - Installation instructions included in fallback messages
  - Enhanced audit summary displays selected components and fallback indicators
  - `--no-fallback` flag for production deployments (fail instead of fallback)
  - Preprocessing mode warnings (auto mode flagged as not production-ready)

- **Testable Strict Mode**: Quick strict mode enables testing with built-in datasets

  - `--strict-quick` flag for development/testing workflows
  - Relaxed validation for built-in datasets (bypasses data path requirements)
  - Still enforces reproducibility (explicit seeds, determinism, manifest generation)
  - Clear warnings distinguish test mode from production strict mode

- **Fast Failure on Invalid Paths**: Pre-flight output validation saves compute time

  - Output directory existence check before running audit pipeline
  - Write permission validation prevents late failures
  - Clear error messages with suggestions (e.g., "mkdir -p /path/to/output")
  - Saves 5-60 seconds per failed audit

- **Model-Explainer Compatibility Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for optimal explainer selection
  - Complete compatibility matrix for all model/explainer combinations
  - Performance benchmarks (German Credit dataset, 1000 samples)
  - Configuration examples and best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
  - Documentation: [Model-Explainer Compatibility](https://glassalpha.com/reference/model-explainer-compatibility/)

### Fixed

- **Critical explainer crash**: Fixed `TypeError` in explainer registry when checking model compatibility. All explainer `is_compatible` methods now use standardized `@classmethod` signature with keyword-only arguments.
- **Explainer contract enforcement**: Added contract tests to validate explainer API signatures, preventing future signature mismatches.

### Performance

- **CLI startup 83% faster**: Optimized `--help` command from 635ms to ~90ms through lazy loading of heavy ML libraries (sklearn, pandas, xgboost).
- **Lazy dataset loading**: Dataset commands now load on-demand rather than at CLI startup, improving responsiveness.
- **Import optimization**: Moved sklearn imports to function scope, eliminating 527ms of unnecessary import overhead.

### Added

- **Preprocessing Artifact Verification**: Load production preprocessing pipelines with integrity verification (12 tests, <1s overhead)

  - Dual hash system: file integrity (SHA256/BLAKE2b) + learned parameters (canonical JSON)
  - CLI commands: `glassalpha prep hash|inspect|validate` with color-coded output
  - Security: Class allowlisting prevents pickle exploits (10 approved sklearn transformers)
  - Version compatibility checking (sklearn/numpy/scipy) with configurable policies (exact/patch/minor)
  - Unknown category detection with three-tier thresholds (notice/warn/fail)
  - Strict mode enforcement: artifact mode + both hashes required
  - Full audit trail in reports with prominent warnings for non-compliant auto mode
  - Documentation: [Preprocessing Guide](https://glassalpha.com/guides/preprocessing/)

- **HTML Report Enhancements**: 20 regulatory improvements to audit reports

  - Navigation: Table of contents with clickable section numbering for regulatory citations
  - Compliance: Model Card section following Mitchell et al. framework
  - Educational: Glossary with 17 key terms for non-technical reviewers
  - Transparency: Preprocessing pipeline diagram with risk indicators
  - Accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, WCAG AA contrast standards
  - Regulatory: Framework citations (GDPR Article 22, ECOA Regulation B with dates)
  - UX: Hash truncation with hover tooltips, page numbers for print/PDF

- **Performance regression tests**: Comprehensive test suite (9 tests) validates CLI performance, explainer contracts, and end-to-end audit functionality.
- **CI performance gates**: Automated performance testing in CI pipeline catches regressions before merge (target: `--help` < 300ms, currently ~90ms).
- **Performance documentation**: Added performance testing section to CONTRIBUTING.md with lazy loading patterns and benchmarks.
- **Audit smoke tests**: End-to-end tests validate full audit pipeline completes successfully with valid PDF and manifest generation.

### Changed

- **Explainer API standardization**: All explainers now implement consistent `is_compatible(cls, *, model=None, model_type=None, config=None)` signature.
- **Registry error handling**: Explainer registry now gracefully handles signature variations with fallback logic and clear error messages.
- **Backward compatibility**: All module imports preserved using `__getattr__` pattern for lazy loading without breaking existing code.

### Technical Details

**Files Modified**: 15 files (6 explainer fixes, 3 performance optimizations, 3 new tests, 3 infrastructure updates)
**Test Coverage**: Added 9 automated tests (7 performance, 1 contract, 1 smoke)
**Performance Baseline**: `--help`: 88ms, `--version`: 46ms, `datasets list`: 248ms, full audit: 4.9s
**CI Integration**: Performance tests run automatically on every PR with 2-3x safety margins
