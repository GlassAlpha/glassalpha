## ⚠️ Warnings Analysis (29 total)

### **Scikit-learn Deprecation Warnings (Majority)**

```
FutureWarning: 'multi_class' was deprecated in version 1.5 and will be removed in 1.8
```

- **Impact:** Low - These are sklearn library warnings, not our code
- **Action:** No action needed - external library deprecation
- **Count:** ~20 warnings

### **Feature Name Warnings**

```
UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but LogisticRegression was fitted with feature names
```

- **Impact:** Low - Expected behavior in some test scenarios
- **Action:** No action needed - test-specific warnings
- **Count:** ~9 warnings

### **Summary**

- **All warnings are external library deprecations or expected test behavior**
- **No warnings from our code changes**
- **No action required**
