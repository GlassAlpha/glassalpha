# Glass Alpha - ML Components Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed in This Session

### 1. Project Setup
- Created virtual environment with all required dependencies
- Installed: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, shap, etc.
- Resolved macOS-specific XGBoost dependency (libomp)

### 2. Directory Structure Created

### 3. Implemented Components

#### XGBoostWrapper (`models/tabular/xgboost.py`)
- âœ… Follows PassThroughModel pattern
- âœ… Implements ModelInterface protocol
- âœ… Supports loading pre-trained models
- âœ… Provides predictions and probabilities
- âœ… Declares capabilities for plugin selection
- âœ… Includes feature importance extraction
- âœ… Successfully registers with ModelRegistry

#### TreeSHAPExplainer (`explain/shap/tree.py`)
- âœ… Follows NoOpExplainer pattern
- âœ… Implements ExplainerInterface protocol
- âœ… Computes exact SHAP values for tree models
- âœ… Supports XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- âœ… Provides global and local explanations
- âœ… Successfully registers with ExplainerRegistry
- âœ… Priority system ensures it's selected first for tree models

### 4. Verified Integration
- âœ… Components register correctly with registry system
- âœ… XGBoostWrapper and TreeSHAPExplainer work together
- âœ… End-to-end demo shows training, wrapping, and explaining
- âœ… SHAP values computed successfully
- âœ… Feature importance extracted and ranked

## ðŸ“Š Current Registry Status

```python
Models: ['passthrough', 'xgboost']
Explainers: ['noop', 'treeshap']
Metrics: ['noop']
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 2-3)
1. **LightGBMWrapper** - Similar pattern to XGBoostWrapper
2. **LogisticRegressionWrapper** - For sklearn models
3. **KernelSHAPExplainer** - Fallback for non-tree models
4. **Performance Metrics** - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
5. **Fairness Metrics** - Demographic parity, Equal opportunity

### Integration Tasks (Week 3-4)
6. **Data Module** - Tabular data loader with schema validation
7. **Utilities** - Seed management, hashing, manifest generation
8. **Audit Pipeline** - Connect all components
9. **Report Generation** - PDF templates and rendering

## ðŸ’¡ Key Patterns Established

1. **Registry Pattern Works**: Components auto-register on import
2. **Plugin Selection**: Explainers use priority system for deterministic selection
3. **Capability Declaration**: Models declare what they support
4. **Protocol Compliance**: All components follow interface contracts
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with informative messages

## âœ… Architecture Validation

The architecture patterns from Phase 0 are proven to work:
- Registry system successfully manages components
- Plugin selection based on capabilities works
- NoOp fallbacks allow partial pipelines
- Enterprise feature flags ready (not yet used)
- Deterministic component selection achievable

## ðŸš€ Ready for Next Phase

With XGBoostWrapper and TreeSHAPExplainer working, the foundation is proven. The same patterns can be applied to implement:
- Additional model wrappers (LightGBM, sklearn)
- More explainers (KernelSHAP)
- Metrics (performance, fairness, drift)
- Full audit pipeline

The architecture successfully supports extensibility without core modifications.
