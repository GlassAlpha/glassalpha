"""Dataset loaders for common benchmark datasets.

This package provides loaders for canonical machine learning datasets
commonly used for fairness and compliance auditing.

Performance note: This module uses lazy imports via __getattr__ to avoid
loading heavy dependencies (pandas, numpy) during CLI --help rendering.
Dataset loaders are imported only when actually accessed, but registration
happens immediately to populate REGISTRY.
