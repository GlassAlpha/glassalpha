# Surgical Coverage Improvements - Risk-Focused Testing Strategy

## âœ… Phase 1: Critical Product Contracts Fixed

All customer-visible contracts have been verified working correctly:

### âœ… Explainer Registry
- **RuntimeError handling**: Unsupported models raise `RuntimeError("No compatible explainer found")`
- **Model compatibility**: XGBoost â†’ TreeSHAP, LogisticRegression â†’ KernelSHAP
- **Priority selection**: Deterministic ordering ensures reproducible explainer selection
- **Object compatibility**: Model wrappers with `get_model_info()` work correctly

### âœ… XGBoost Wrapper
- **fit() method**: Complete implementation with `random_state`, `feature_names_`, `n_classes` tracking
- **Round-trip integrity**: fit â†’ save â†’ load â†’ predict pipeline works correctly
- **Metadata preservation**: Feature names and class info survive serialization

### âœ… Template Packaging
- **Wheel inclusion**: `standard_audit.html` packaged correctly via `importlib.resources`
- **Content validation**: 46,484 characters loaded successfully from wheel
- **Access patterns**: Both file system and resources access working

### âœ… Git Helpers
- **subprocess.run**: All calls use `text=True` - no `.decode()` usage anywhere
- **Status mapping**: "clean"/"dirty" status correctly mapped from `git status --porcelain`
- **Error handling**: `FileNotFoundError` returns `None` gracefully

### âœ… Hashing Error Handling
- **Error message**: Raises exactly `ValueError("Cannot hash object")` on serialization failure
- **Contract compliance**: Exact string matching for test assertions

### âœ… Printf-Style Logging Elimination
- **AST validation**: Zero printf-style logging violations detected
- **Contract compliance**: All logging uses single f-string arguments

## âœ… Phase 2: Wheel-First CI Locked

Robust build process with comprehensive validation:

### âœ… Dist Hygiene
- **Clean builds**: Exactly 1 project wheel in `dist/` (validated with dual tests)
- **No dependencies**: Uses `python -m build --wheel --outdir dist` (no dependency download)
- **Build tools**: Explicit `build` module installation before usage

### âœ… Dependency Management
- **Conservative stack**: Pinned compatible versions of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn
- **GPU guardrails**: Detection and warnings for unwanted heavy packages
- **Smoke tests**: Version check and CLI functionality validated after install

### âœ… Git Integration
- **Full history**: `fetch-depth: 0` for manifest generation tests
- **CI identity**: Proper git user configuration for testing
- **Contract validation**: Early feedback with focused contract test execution

## âœ… Phase 3: Surgical Coverage Implementation

High-value, risk-focused testing strategy implemented:

## ðŸŽ¯ High-Value Risk Tests Created

### 1. Explainer Selection Risk Tests (`test_explainer_selection_risk.py`)
**Why**: Explainer selection is the core differentiator - failures block all explanations

**Coverage**: 7 critical path tests
- âœ… XGBoost â†’ TreeSHAP default selection
- âœ… LogisticRegression â†’ KernelSHAP selection
- âœ… Priority ordering determinism
- âœ… RuntimeError for unsupported models
- âœ… Mock model object compatibility
- âœ… Graceful degradation for invalid inputs

**Risk Reduction**: Prevents explainer selection failures that would block customer audits

### 2. Wrapper Round-Trip Risk Tests (`test_wrapper_roundtrip_risk.py`)
**Why**: Save/load failures lose customer model investments and break audit reproducibility

**Coverage**: 5 critical pipeline tests
- âœ… XGBoost fit â†’ save â†’ load â†’ predict integrity
- âœ… Feature names preservation across round-trips
- âœ… Model coefficients preservation (explainability critical)
- âœ… Parent directory creation (prevents file system errors)
- âœ… Unfitted model error handling

**Risk Reduction**: Prevents model loss and ensures audit reproducibility

### 3. Git Helpers Risk Tests (`test_git_helpers_risk.py`)
**Why**: Git info collection failures break audit manifest generation and regulatory compliance

**Coverage**: 8 subprocess and status tests
- âœ… subprocess.run text mode validation
- âœ… Clean vs dirty status detection
- âœ… Git unavailability graceful handling
- âœ… No `.decode()` usage verification (prevents CI failures)
- âœ… Environment collection robustness

**Risk Reduction**: Prevents manifest generation failures and CI decode errors

### 4. Golden Report Snapshot Tests (`test_golden_report_snapshots.py`)
**Why**: Template regressions break customer-facing audit reports without requiring 100% renderer coverage

**Coverage**: 9 template structure and security tests
- âœ… Required regulatory sections (explainability, performance, features)
- âœ… Valid HTML structure for browser rendering
- âœ… Jinja2 variable presence for dynamic content
- âœ… CSS styling for professional appearance
- âœ… Security vulnerability detection (XSS, unsafe DOM, external scripts)
- âœ… Template size and encoding validation

**Risk Reduction**: Catches customer-visible report regressions early

### 5. Versioned Serialization Risk Tests (`test_versioned_serialization_risk.py`)
**Why**: Format changes that break model loading lose customer model investments

**Coverage**: 6 forward compatibility tests
- âœ… Legacy v1 format loading (backward compatibility)
- âœ… Version information preservation (forward compatibility)
- âœ… XGBoost JSON format stability across library versions
- âœ… Schema evolution handling (unknown fields gracefully ignored)
- âœ… Model format validation (consistent structure)
- âœ… Corrupted file handling (graceful error messages)

**Risk Reduction**: Prevents model format breaking changes from losing customer models

## ðŸ“Š Surgical Coverage Configurations

### Critical Modules Coverage (`.coveragerc.critical`)
**Target**: 50% line + branch coverage (building to 85%)
**Scope**: Blast radius components customers interact with directly
- `*/glassalpha/pipeline/*` - Core audit orchestration
- `*/glassalpha/models/tabular/*` - Model wrappers
- `*/glassalpha/explain/registry.py` - Explainer selection
- `*/glassalpha/utils/manifest.py` - Audit trail generation
- `*/glassalpha/utils/proc.py` - Subprocess utilities

**Current Results**: 13.41% with 8 focused tests
- **Explainer registry**: 74.19% (15 missed, 7 partial branches)
- **XGBoost wrapper**: 63.32% (51 missed, 12 partial branches)
- **Base wrapper**: 46.03% (27 missed, 1 partial branch)

### Utilities Coverage (`.coveragerc.utilities`)
**Target**: 50% line + branch coverage (building to 80%)
**Scope**: Supporting utilities - important but lower customer impact
- `*/glassalpha/utils/hashing.py` - Deterministic hashing
- `*/glassalpha/utils/seeds.py` - Reproducibility control
- `*/glassalpha/config/*` - Configuration validation

### Contract-Only Coverage (`.coveragerc.contracts`)
**Target**: 49% line coverage
**Scope**: Contract-critical modules only
- `*/glassalpha/constants.py` - Contract string definitions
- `*/glassalpha/models/_features.py` - Feature alignment logic
- `*/glassalpha/models/tabular/base.py` - Shared wrapper functionality

**Current Results**: 62.37% âœ… Well above threshold

## ðŸŽ¯ Coverage Strategy Philosophy

### Risk-Based Prioritization
1. **Critical path coverage** (explainer selection, save/load, subprocess)
2. **Customer-visible coverage** (reports, error messages, audit results)
3. **Regulatory compliance coverage** (manifest generation, reproducibility)
4. **Data integrity coverage** (feature alignment, serialization, hashing)

### Branch Coverage Focus
- **Line coverage alone is vanity** - branch coverage catches edge cases
- **Focus on decision points** - if/else, try/except, loop conditions
- **Test both success and failure paths** - error handling is critical

### Diff Coverage (Future)
- **90% line, 80% branch on changed lines** - stops backsliding where it matters
- **Prevents coverage regressions** on new code without requiring 100% everywhere
- **Fast feedback loop** for developers

## ðŸ“ˆ Incremental Improvement Plan

### Week 1 (Current): Foundation + High-Value Tests âœ…
- âœ… Critical contracts verified working
- âœ… Wheel-first CI locked and stable

- âœ… Surgical coverage configurations implemented

### Week 2: Critical Module Focus
- **Target**: Raise critical modules to 60% line + 50% branch
- **Method**: Add targeted tests for identified gaps
- **Focus**: Pipeline orchestration, model wrapper edge cases

### Week 3: Utilities Hardening
- **Target**: Raise utilities to 70% line + 60% branch
