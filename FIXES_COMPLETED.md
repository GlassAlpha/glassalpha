## ✅ Completed Fixes

### Fix #1: CLI `models` Command ✅

**Issue:** Command crashed with `AttributeError: 'PluginRegistry' object has no attribute 'available_plugins'`
**Root Cause:** CLI imported from wrong module (`plugin_registry` instead of `registry`)
**Fix:** Changed import in `packages/src/glassalpha/cli/main.py:237`
**Files Changed:**

- `packages/src/glassalpha/cli/main.py`

**Verification:**

```bash
$ glassalpha models
Available Models:
==================================================
  ✅ passthrough
  ✅ logistic_regression (included in base install)
  ✅ sklearn_generic (included in base install)
  ✅ xgboost
  ✅ lightgbm
```

---

### Fix #2: Dataset Fetch Command ✅

**Issue:** Command crashed with `ImportError: cannot import name '_ensure_dataset_availability'`
**Root Cause:** Function was a private method in AuditPipeline, not a standalone function
**Fix:** Refactored `datasets.py` to call dataset spec's `fetch_fn()` directly
**Files Changed:**

- `packages/src/glassalpha/cli/datasets.py`

**Verification:**

```bash
$ glassalpha datasets fetch german_credit
✅ Dataset 'german_credit' already cached
📁 Location: /Users/gabe/Library/Application Support/glassalpha/data/german_credit_processed.csv
💡 Use --force to re-download
```

---

### Fix #3: LightGBM Detection ✅

**Issue:** LightGBM not detected even when installed, fell back to LogisticRegression
**Root Cause:** Model modules weren't being auto-imported, so they never registered themselves
**Fix:** Added auto-import of model modules in:

1. `packages/src/glassalpha/core/__init__.py` - imports models package
2. `packages/src/glassalpha/models/__init__.py` - imports wrappers
3. `packages/src/glassalpha/models/tabular/__init__.py` - conditional imports with try/except

**Files Changed:**

- `packages/src/glassalpha/core/__init__.py`
- `packages/src/glassalpha/models/__init__.py`
- `packages/src/glassalpha/models/tabular/__init__.py`

**Verification:**

```bash
$ glassalpha audit --config test_lightgbm_config.yaml --output test.html
# Output shows:
# - "Training lightgbm model from configuration"
# - "Trained LightGBM model with 19 features"
# - "Model: lightgbm"
```

## 📊 Test Results

### Regression Tests

```bash
$ cd packages && pytest tests/ -q
857 passed, 16 skipped, 29 warnings in 32.99s
```

✅ All existing tests still pass
✅ No regressions introduced
✅ Model detection works for all models

### Integration Tests (Manual)

- ✅ LogisticRegression with included data
- ✅ XGBoost with included data
- ✅ LightGBM with included data (NOW WORKS!)
- ✅ Custom data loading works
- ✅ CLI commands work

## 📝 Technical Details

### Import Chain for Model Registration

**Before (Broken):**

```python
from glassalpha.core import ModelRegistry
# Models not imported → not registered → not available
```

**After (Fixed):**

```python
from glassalpha.core import ModelRegistry
# core/__init__.py imports glassalpha.models
# models/__init__.py imports tabular wrappers
# Each wrapper registers itself on import
# → All installed models are now available
```

### Key Insight

The architecture uses self-registration pattern where models register themselves when imported. The issue was that nothing was importing them automatically, so they never registered. The fix ensures models are imported when the core module is imported, which happens in almost all usage scenarios.

## 🎯 Verification Commands

To verify all fixes work:

```bash
# Fix #1: Models command
glassalpha models

# Fix #2: Dataset fetch
glassalpha datasets fetch german_credit

# Fix #3: LightGBM detection
echo "model:
  type: lightgbm
data:
  dataset: german_credit
" > test_config.yaml
glassalpha audit --config test_config.yaml --output test.html
grep -i "lightgbm" test.html  # Should find LightGBM mentioned
```

---

## ⏱️ Time Spent

- **Fix #1 (models command):** ~10 minutes (investigation + fix + test)
- **Fix #2 (dataset fetch):** ~20 minutes (refactoring required)
- **Fix #3 (LightGBM):** ~45 minutes (complex debugging to find root cause)
- **Testing & verification:** ~15 minutes
- **Total:** ~90 minutes
