# GlassAlpha Configuration: Counterfactual Recourse (German Credit)
#
# This configuration demonstrates recourse generation with policy constraints
# for the German Credit dataset. Generates feasible counterfactual recommendations
# for individuals receiving adverse credit decisions.
#
# Usage:
#   glassalpha recourse \
#     --model models/german_credit.pkl \
#     --data data/test.csv \
#     --instance 42 \
#     --config configs/recourse_german_credit.yaml \
#     --output recourse/instance_42.json

# Data Configuration

# Recourse Configuration - Very permissive for testing
recourse:
  enabled: true

  # For testing: only make age immutable, remove most constraints
  immutable_features:
    - age # Cannot change age

  # Remove monotonic constraints for testing
  monotonic_constraints: {}

  # Cost function for optimization
  cost_function: weighted_l1 # Weighted L1 distance

  # Maximum iterations for optimization

# Reproducibility

  deterministic: true
# German Credit Feature Semantics
#
# Easily Modifiable (Low Cost):
# - checking_balance: Open new account, transfer funds
# - savings_balance: Deposit savings
# - purpose: Change loan purpose
#
# Moderately Modifiable (Medium Cost):
# - credit_amount: Request different amount
# - duration: Adjust loan duration
# - installment_rate: Negotiate different rate
#
# Difficult to Modify (High Cost):
# - employment_duration: Requires time/job change
# - property: Requires purchasing property
# - other_installment_plans: Complex financial restructuring
#
# Immutable (Cannot Change):
# - age: Cannot change
# - gender: Protected attribute
# - foreign_worker: Immigration status
# - present_residence_duration: Historical data
#
# Policy Rationale:
# This configuration balances feasibility (what individuals can actually change)
# with ECOA compliance (avoiding protected attributes). Monotonic constraints
# ensure recommendations are realistic (e.g., don't suggest increasing debt).
