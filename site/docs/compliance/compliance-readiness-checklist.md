| Small sample sizes (n<30)    | Collect more data or aggregate groups                                              |
| Wide confidence intervals    | Acknowledge as limitation in report                                                |
| Failed policy gates          | See gate-specific remediation in [Policy Guide](../guides/policy-configuration.md) |
| Non-reproducible results     | Ensure seed set: `random_seed: 42` and `--strict` flag used                        |
