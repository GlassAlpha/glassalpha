# Regulatory Compliance Vision

!!! warning "Pre-Alpha Development"
    Glass Alpha is under active development. The compliance features described here represent our design goals, not current capabilities.

!!! warning "Legal Disclaimer"
    This documentation provides general technical guidance. **Always consult qualified legal counsel** for specific regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction.

## Our Compliance Mission

Glass Alpha aims to help organizations meet the documentation and audit requirements of modern AI governance frameworks through:

1. **Deterministic audit reports** - Reproducible PDF documentation for regulatory review
2. **Model explanations** - TreeSHAP-based interpretability for individual decisions
3. **Fairness metrics** - Basic bias detection and protected attribute analysis
4. **Complete lineage** - Full tracking of data, model, and configuration versions

## Target Regulatory Frameworks

### Initial Focus Areas

Our initial development targets common requirements across multiple frameworks:

#### United States
- **FCRA/ECOA** - Credit and lending decisions requiring explanations and fairness testing
- **EEOC Guidelines** - Employment decisions with Four-Fifths Rule compliance
- **SR 11-7** - Model risk management for financial services

#### European Union  
- **GDPR Article 22** - Right to explanation for automated decision-making
- **AI Act** - Documentation requirements for high-risk AI systems

### Design Principles for Compliance

1. **Transparency First** - Every decision should be explainable
2. **Audit-Ready** - Documentation suitable for regulatory review
3. **Reproducibility** - Byte-identical outputs under same conditions
4. **Privacy by Design** - No external calls, on-premise deployment

## Target Use Cases

Glass Alpha is being designed with these key domains in mind:

### Financial Services (Credit/Lending)
- **Challenge**: Prove fair lending practices and ECOA compliance
- **Our Goal**: Generate audit reports demonstrating model fairness and decision explanations
- **Key Metrics**: Disparate impact ratios, protected class analysis

### Employment/Hiring
- **Challenge**: Meet EEOC Four-Fifths Rule requirements
- **Our Goal**: Document adverse impact analysis and bias testing
- **Key Metrics**: Selection rates by protected group, statistical parity

### Healthcare/Insurance
- **Challenge**: Ensure algorithmic fairness while maintaining privacy
- **Our Goal**: Provide bias analysis without exposing sensitive data
- **Key Metrics**: Group fairness metrics, demographic parity

## Planned Compliance Features

Our design targets these core capabilities:

### 1. Deterministic Outputs
- Byte-identical PDF reports under same configuration
- Complete random seed tracking
- Immutable run manifests with hashes

### 2. Complete Audit Trail
- Git commit SHA for code version
- Dataset fingerprints (SHA-256)  
- Configuration hashes
- Timestamp and environment info

### 3. Protected Attribute Analysis
- Configurable protected classes
- Basic fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Disparate impact calculations

### 4. Model Explanations
- TreeSHAP feature importance
- Individual prediction explanations
- Waterfall plots for key decisions

### 5. Professional Documentation
- PDF audit reports with professional formatting
- Executive summaries for stakeholders
- Technical details for validation teams

## How Glass Alpha Will Help

### What We're Building

Glass Alpha will provide technical tools to support compliance efforts:

1. **Generate Audit Reports** - Create PDF documentation for regulatory review
2. **Test for Bias** - Identify potential discrimination in model decisions
3. **Explain Decisions** - Provide clear explanations for individual predictions
4. **Track Changes** - Maintain complete audit trails of model versions

### What Users Will Still Need

Even with Glass Alpha, organizations will need:

- Legal counsel to interpret regulatory requirements
- Domain experts to validate model appropriateness
- Governance processes for model review and approval
- Human oversight for high-stakes decisions

## Development Priorities

Our development focuses on the most common compliance needs:

1. **Deterministic PDF generation** - For regulatory filing
2. **Basic fairness metrics** - For bias detection
3. **TreeSHAP explanations** - For decision transparency
4. **Reproducibility manifests** - For audit trails

Future phases may expand to additional compliance requirements based on user needs.
