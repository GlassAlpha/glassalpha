## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
- **Financial lending decisions** → Full ECOA/FCRA compliance required
- **Employment screening** → EEOC guidelines mandatory  
- **Healthcare algorithms** → Clinical validation essential
- **Government services** → Constitutional due process concerns

### Medium-Risk Scenarios
- **Marketing personalization** → Privacy and fairness considerations
- **Insurance underwriting** → Anti-discrimination requirements
- **Educational assessment** → Equal opportunity concerns

### Lower-Risk Scenarios
- **Product recommendations** → Minimal regulatory requirements
- **Fraud detection** → Focus on accuracy and false positives
- **Internal operations** → Business policy compliance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment
