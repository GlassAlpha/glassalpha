# EU AI Act Compliance Mapping

## Overview

This document maps **GlassAlpha features** to **EU AI Act requirements** for high-risk AI systems. Use this as a reference when demonstrating compliance with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act.

**Regulation**: [EU Artificial Intelligence Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206) (Regulation 2024/1689)

**Scope**: High-risk AI systems as defined in Annex III, including credit scoring, employment decisions, and other uses affecting fundamental rights.

**Status**: The EU AI Act entered into force in August 2024. Full compliance required by August 2026 for most high-risk systems.
