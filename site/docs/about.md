# About Glass Alpha

GlassAlpha is built as an **extensible framework** for AI compliance and interpretability, starting with tabular ML models in Phase 1 and designed to expand to LLMs and multimodal systems.

## Why Glass Alpha?

### The Problem

As AI regulations tighten globally (EU AI Act, CFPB guidance, state-level bills), regulated industries are most exposed. Finance, insurance, healthcare, and defense increasingly rely on ML models for high-stakes decisions: loan approvals, fraud detection, underwriting, patient triage, targeting systems, etc.

These organizations need **transparent, auditable ML systems**. But most ML models are black boxes, and existing audit tools are either:

- Academic research code (not production-ready)
- Enterprise SaaS platforms (vendor lock-in, data privacy concerns)
- Custom internal tools (inconsistent, non-reproducible)

### The Solution

Glass Alpha provides **deterministic, regulator-ready audit reports** with complete lineage tracking. Run the same config twice, get byte-identical PDFs. Every decision is explainable, every metric is reproducible, every audit trail is complete.

### Who This Helps

- **Data Scientists**: Generate compliance documentation without manual report writing
- **Legal/Compliance Teams**: Get standardized, defensible audit reports for regulatory review
- **Risk Managers**: Monitor model fairness and drift with quantitative metrics
- **Auditors**: Verify model behavior with reproducible, transparent analysis

### Why Open Source

Compliance tools require trust. Open source code means regulators, auditors, and your team can verify exactly how conclusions were reached. No proprietary black boxes auditing your black boxes.
