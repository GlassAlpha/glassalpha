# Quick start guide

## The 60-second version

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlassAlpha/glassalpha
cd glassalpha/packages

# Install base framework (includes LogisticRegression baseline)
pip install -e .

# Check what models are available
glassalpha models
```

### Generate an audit PDF (uses included German Credit example)

```bash
# Quick start with LogisticRegression (always available)
glassalpha audit --config configs/quickstart.yaml --output audit.pdf

# Or use the German Credit example (also uses LogisticRegression now)
glassalpha audit --config configs/german_credit_simple.yaml --output audit.pdf
```

That's it! You now have a complete audit report with model performance, SHAP explanations, and fairness metrics.

## The 10-minute version

Get up and running with GlassAlpha in less than 10 minutes. This guide will take you from installation to generating your first professional audit PDF.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- 2GB available disk space
- Command line access

## Step 1: Installation

### Clone and install

Clone and setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlassAlpha/glassalpha
cd glassalpha/packages
```

Python 3.11 or 3.12 recommended:

```bash
python3 --version   # should show 3.11.x or 3.12.x
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install GlassAlpha:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Option 1: Base install (LogisticRegression only, recommended for getting started)
pip install -e .

# Option 2: With advanced ML libraries (if you need XGBoost/LightGBM)
pip install -e ".[xgboost]"      # XGBoost + SHAP
pip install -e ".[lightgbm]"     # LightGBM only
pip install -e ".[tabular]"      # All advanced models

# Option 3: Development install (includes testing tools)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Verify installation:

```bash
glassalpha --help

# Check what models are available
glassalpha models
```

You should see the CLI help message with available commands.

## Step 2: Generate your first audit

GlassAlpha comes with a ready-to-use German Credit dataset example that demonstrates all core capabilities.

### Run the audit command

Generate audit PDF (takes ~3 seconds):

```bash
glassalpha audit \
  --config configs/german_credit_simple.yaml \
  --output my_first_audit.pdf
```

### What happens

1. **Automatic Dataset Resolution**: Uses built-in German Credit dataset from registry
2. **Model Training**: Trains XGBoost classifier with optimal parameters
3. **Explanations**: Generates TreeSHAP feature importance analysis
4. **Fairness Analysis**: Computes bias metrics for protected attributes (gender, age)
5. **PDF Generation**: Creates professional audit report with visualizations

### Expected output

## Step 3: Review your audit report

Open `my_first_audit.pdf` to see your comprehensive audit report containing:

### Executive summary

- Key findings and compliance status
- Model performance overview
- Bias detection results
- Regulatory assessment

### Model performance analysis

- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC
- Confusion matrix
- Performance visualizations

### SHAP explanations

- Global feature importance rankings
- Individual prediction explanations
- Waterfall plots showing decision factors

### Fairness analysis

- Demographic parity assessment
- Equal opportunity analysis
- Bias detection across protected attributes
- Statistical significance testing

### Reproducibility manifest

- Complete audit trail with timestamps
- Dataset fingerprints and model parameters
- Random seeds and component versions
- Git commit information

## Step 4: Understanding the configuration

The `configs/german_credit_simple.yaml` file contains all audit settings:

Audit profile determines component selection:

```yaml
audit_profile: german_credit_default
```

Reproducibility settings:

```yaml
reproducibility:
  random_seed: 42
```

Data configuration:

```yaml
data:
  dataset: german_credit # Uses built-in German Credit dataset
  fetch: if_missing # Automatically download if needed
  target_column: credit_risk
  protected_attributes:
    - gender
    - age_group
    - foreign_worker
```

Model configuration:

```yaml
model:
  type: xgboost
  params:
    objective: binary:logistic
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 5
```

Explainer selection:

```yaml
explainers:
  strategy: first_compatible
  priority:
    - treeshap # Primary choice for tree models
    - kernelshap # Fallback for any model type
```

Metrics to compute:

```yaml
metrics:
  performance:
    metrics: [accuracy, precision, recall, f1, auc_roc]
  fairness:
    metrics: [demographic_parity, equal_opportunity]
```

## Next steps

### Try advanced features

Enable strict mode for regulatory compliance:

```bash
glassalpha audit \
  --config configs/german_credit_simple.yaml \
  --output regulatory_audit.pdf \
  --strict
```

Use a different model (edit config file: model.type: lightgbm):

```bash
glassalpha audit \
  --config configs/german_credit_simple.yaml \
  --output lightgbm_audit.pdf
```

### Explore more options

See all available CLI options:

```bash
glassalpha audit --help
```

List available components:

```bash
glassalpha list
```

Validate configuration without running audit:

```bash
glassalpha validate --config configs/german_credit_simple.yaml
```

Manage datasets:

```bash
glassalpha datasets list        # See available datasets
glassalpha datasets info german_credit  # Show dataset details
glassalpha datasets cache-dir   # Show where datasets are cached
```

### Work with your own data

1. **Prepare your data**: CSV format with target column and features
2. **Create configuration**: Copy and modify `german_credit_simple.yaml`
3. **Run audit**: Use your configuration file

See the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for detailed customization options.
