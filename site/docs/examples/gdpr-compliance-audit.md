# GDPR Compliance Audit Tutorial

Complete walkthrough of performing a comprehensive ML audit on an automated decision-making system using GlassAlpha. This tutorial demonstrates how to audit consent prediction models for compliance with EU GDPR Article 22 and data protection impact assessment requirements.

## Overview

Organizations use machine learning models to predict customer consent for marketing communications and data processing activities. These models must comply with:

- **GDPR Article 22**: Rights regarding automated decision-making including profiling
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)**: Systematic assessment of processing risks
- **Consent Management**: Freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent
- **Transparency**: Right to explanation for automated decisions

### What You'll Learn

- How to configure GlassAlpha for GDPR Article 22 compliance auditing
- Interpreting performance metrics for automated decision-making systems
- Understanding SHAP explanations for consent prediction transparency
- Identifying bias in consent decisions across demographic groups
- Generating regulatory-ready audit reports for EU data protection compliance

### Regulatory Context

GDPR Article 22 compliance requires:

- **Automated Decision-Making Rights**: Individuals have rights regarding automated decisions

## Step 4: Interpreting the Results

### Model Performance Analysis

**Overall Performance:**

- **Accuracy: 78.9%** - Model correctly predicts 79% of consent decisions
- **AUC-ROC: 0.856** - Good discriminative ability for consent prediction
- **Precision: 76.3%** - Of predicted consents, 76% are actually granted
- **Recall: 72.1%** - Model identifies 72% of all actual consent grants

**GDPR Compliance Interpretation:**

- **Consent Accuracy**: 79% accuracy meets reasonable standards for automated consent prediction
- **False Positive Rate**: 24% of predicted consents are actually denied
- **False Negative Rate**: 28% of actual consents are missed
- **Business Impact**: Balance between consent acquisition and regulatory compliance

### SHAP Explanations

**Global Feature Importance (Top 5):**

1. **`data_processing_consent` (+0.312)**

   - Most important GDPR compliance factor
   - Explicit consent for data processing strongly predicts marketing consent
   - Demonstrates importance of clear consent mechanisms

2. **`marketing_emails_opened` (+0.287)**

   - Email engagement strongly correlates with marketing consent
   - Indicates active interest in brand communications
   - Important behavioral indicator of consent likelihood

3. **`purchase_frequency` (+0.234)**

   - Frequent customers more likely to grant marketing consent
   - Transactional relationship strength predicts consent willingness
   - Demonstrates legitimate interest basis for processing

4. **`customer_since_years` (+0.198)**

   - Longer customer relationships correlate with consent likelihood
   - Trust and familiarity increase consent probability
   - Important for relationship-based consent justification

5. **`loyalty_program_tier` (+0.156)**

   - Higher loyalty program participation predicts consent
   - Engagement level indicates marketing communication preferences
   - Supports legitimate interest legal basis

**Individual Customer Example:**
For a 35-year-old customer with high engagement and loyalty program membership:

- **Base consent probability:** 0.65 (65% population average)
- **Data processing consent (yes):** +0.18 probability increase
- **Marketing emails opened (85%):** +0.15 probability increase
- **Purchase frequency (25/year):** +0.12 probability increase
- **Customer tenure (8 years):** +0.08 probability increase
- **Loyalty program tier (3):** +0.06 probability increase
- **Final consent probability:** 0.94 (94% - high confidence in consent)

### Fairness Analysis Results

**Demographic Parity Analysis:**

**Age Group Consent Rates:**

- **Young (18-24):** 62.3% predicted consent rate
- **Young Adult (25-34):** 68.7% predicted consent rate
- **Middle Age (35-49):** 74.2% predicted consent rate
- **Senior (50-64):** 78.9% predicted consent rate
- **Elderly (65+):** 82.1% predicted consent rate
- **Maximum difference:** 19.8% (Young vs. Elderly)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant age-based disparities detected

**EU Citizenship Analysis:**

- **EU Citizens:** 74.2% predicted consent rate
- **Non-EU Residents:** 71.8% predicted consent rate
- **Difference:** 2.4% (within acceptable range)
- **Conclusion:** ‚úÖ No significant citizenship bias detected

**Predictive Parity Analysis:**

- **Young:** 73.2% precision (of flagged young customers, 73% actually consent)
- **Elderly:** 84.7% precision
- **Difference:** 11.5% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Age-based accuracy disparity in consent prediction

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Findings:**

1. **Age-Based Consent Disparities**

   - 19.8% difference in predicted consent rates across age groups
   - May indicate age discrimination in consent prediction
   - Could result in GDPR Article 22 violations
   - Requires immediate review and model adjustment

2. **Automated Decision-Making Concerns**
   - 30% of customers subject to automated consent decisions
   - Requires enhanced transparency and human oversight
   - Must ensure meaningful human intervention capabilities

**Medium Risk Findings:**

**Consent Prediction Accuracy**

- 21% false positive rate may lead to unwanted marketing
- 28% false negative rate misses consent opportunities
- Balance needed between consent accuracy and customer experience

**Compliance Assessment:**

- **GDPR Article 22:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW - Age bias requires attention
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment:** ‚úÖ PASS - Comprehensive risk analysis
- **Consent Management:** ‚úÖ PASS - Explicit consent tracking
- **Transparency:** ‚úÖ PASS - SHAP explanations provide clear rationale
