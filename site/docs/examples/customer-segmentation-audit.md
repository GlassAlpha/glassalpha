# Customer Segmentation Audit Tutorial

Complete walkthrough of performing a comprehensive ML audit on a multi-class customer segmentation model using GlassAlpha. This tutorial demonstrates how to audit automated customer classification systems for compliance with marketing regulations and consumer privacy laws.

## Overview

Companies use machine learning models to segment customers for targeted marketing campaigns. These models must balance:

- **Marketing Effectiveness**: Accurate customer grouping for relevant messaging
- **Privacy Compliance**: Respect for consumer data protection rights
- **Fairness**: Avoid discriminatory segmentation practices
- **Transparency**: Ability to explain segmentation decisions to consumers

### What You'll Learn

- How to configure GlassAlpha for multi-class classification problems
- Interpreting performance metrics for customer segmentation
- Understanding SHAP explanations for customer grouping decisions
- Identifying bias in marketing segmentation across demographic groups
- Generating regulatory-ready audit reports for marketing compliance

### Regulatory Context

Customer segmentation models must comply with:

- **Consumer Privacy Laws**: GDPR, CCPA data processing requirements
- **Marketing Regulations**: CAN-SPAM, TCPA opt-out requirements
- **Anti-Discrimination Laws**: Fair treatment across protected groups
- **Transparency Requirements**: Right to explanation for automated decisions

## Prerequisites

- GlassAlpha installed ([Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md))
- Basic understanding of customer segmentation and marketing analytics
- Familiarity with privacy and fairness concepts in consumer data usage

## Step 1: Understanding the Customer Segmentation Dataset

### Dataset Characteristics

The customer segmentation dataset contains:

- **20,000 synthetic customers**
- **18 features** covering demographics, behavior, and financial indicators
- **4 customer segments**: High-Value, Regular, Occasional, At-Risk
- **Protected attributes**: Gender, age groups for fairness analysis

### Customer Segments

**Segment 0: High-Value Customers**

- High income, frequent purchases, loyalty program members
- Premium product preferences, high engagement
- Most profitable customer group

**Segment 1: Regular Customers**

- Moderate income, consistent purchasing patterns
- Standard product preferences, moderate engagement
- Steady, reliable customer base

**Segment 2: Occasional Customers**

- Variable income, sporadic purchasing behavior
- Discount-driven purchases, low engagement
- Growth opportunity segment

**Segment 3: At-Risk Customers**

- Declining engagement, potential churn risk
- Price-sensitive, low loyalty program participation
- Retention focus required

### Key Features

## Step 4: Interpreting the Results

### Model Performance Analysis

**Overall Performance:**

- **Accuracy: 76.2%** - Model correctly classifies 76% of customers
- **Macro Precision: 74.8%** - Average precision across all segments
- **Macro Recall: 75.1%** - Average recall across all segments
- **Macro F1: 74.9%** - Balanced performance across segments

**Multi-Class Business Interpretation:**

- **Marketing Impact**: 76% accuracy enables reasonably targeted campaigns
- **Error Analysis**: 24% misclassification rate requires business consideration
- **Segment Distribution**: High-Value (28%), Regular (32%), Occasional (25%), At-Risk (15%)

### SHAP Explanations

**Global Feature Importance (Top 5):**

**1. `purchase_frequency` (+0.287)**

- Most important segmentation factor
- Frequent purchasers clearly separated into high-value segments
- Strong behavioral indicator of customer value

**2. `income` (+0.234)**

- Income level strongly influences segment assignment
- Higher income customers more likely in high-value segments
- Requires monitoring for socioeconomic bias

**3. `loyalty_program_member` (+0.198)**

- Program participation strongly correlated with high-value segments
- Self-selection bias in loyalty program membership
- Important for understanding customer engagement

**4. `avg_order_value` (+0.156)**

- Transaction size indicates customer value orientation
- Higher-value customers make larger purchases
- Correlates with willingness to pay premium prices

**5. `social_media_engagement` (+0.142)**

- Digital engagement level influences segmentation
- Higher engagement associated with active customer segments
- May correlate with younger demographics

**Individual Customer Example:**
For a 35-year-old customer with $85,000 income, purchasing 45 times per year:

- **Base segment probability:** High-Value (0.35), Regular (0.30), Occasional (0.25), At-Risk (0.10)
- **Purchase frequency (45):** +0.12 shift toward High-Value
- **Income ($85,000):** +0.08 shift toward High-Value
- **Loyalty program member:** +0.06 shift toward High-Value
- **Average order value ($150):** +0.04 shift toward High-Value
- **Final segment:** High-Value (0.65 probability)

### Fairness Analysis Results

**Demographic Parity Analysis:**

**Age Group Representation:**

- **Young (18-24):** 12% High-Value, 28% Regular, 35% Occasional, 25% At-Risk
- **Young Adult (25-34):** 22% High-Value, 32% Regular, 28% Occasional, 18% At-Risk
- **Middle Age (35-49):** 35% High-Value, 30% Regular, 22% Occasional, 13% At-Risk
- **Senior (50-64):** 28% High-Value, 35% Regular, 25% Occasional, 12% At-Risk
- **Elderly (65+):** 18% High-Value, 38% Regular, 28% Occasional, 16% At-Risk
- **Conclusion:** Age groups represented proportionally in segments

**Gender Analysis:**

- **Male:** 26% High-Value, 32% Regular, 26% Occasional, 16% At-Risk
- **Female:** 24% High-Value, 31% Regular, 27% Occasional, 18% At-Risk
- **Difference:** 2% maximum (within acceptable range)
- **Conclusion:** ‚úÖ No significant gender bias in segment distribution

**Equal Opportunity Analysis:**

- **Young:** 71.2% accuracy in segment classification
- **Middle Age:** 78.4% accuracy in segment classification
- **Difference:** 7.2% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight accuracy disparity across age groups

### Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk Findings:**

**1. Age-Based Accuracy Disparity**

- 7.2% difference in classification accuracy across age groups
- May indicate model difficulty with younger customer patterns
- Consider age-specific model tuning or feature adjustments

**2. Income Correlation**

- Income strongly influences segment assignment
- May create socioeconomic segmentation bias
- Monitor for equitable treatment across income levels

**Low Risk Findings:**

1. **Overall Model Performance**: 76% accuracy is reasonable for marketing segmentation
2. **Demographic Parity**: Balanced representation across protected groups
3. **Interpretability**: Clear feature importance provides business insights

**Compliance Assessment:**

- **Privacy Compliance:** ‚úÖ PASS - Data processing respects consumer rights
- **Marketing Regulations:** ‚úÖ PASS - No discriminatory segmentation detected
- **Transparency:** ‚úÖ PASS - SHAP explanations provide clear rationale
- **Fairness:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW - Minor age-based accuracy differences noted

## Step 5: Regulatory Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

**1. Address Age Accuracy Disparity**

- Investigate why younger customers are harder to classify accurately
- Consider age-specific model parameters or additional features
- Validate with diverse age group test data

**2. Income Feature Review**
