- **Precision: 87.4%** - Of flagged transactions, 87% are actually fraudulent
- **Recall: 79.2%** - Model catches 79% of all fraudulent transactions

**Fraud Detection Business Interpretation:**
- **False Positive Rate**: 13% of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged
- **False Negative Rate**: 21% of fraudulent transactions missed
- **Business Impact**: Balance between fraud losses and customer friction
- **Regulatory Impact**: Must justify false positive rates to card networks

### SHAP Explanations

**Global Feature Importance (Top 5):**

1. **`amount_deviation_score` (+0.342)**
   - Most important fraud indicator
   - Measures how unusual the transaction amount is for this customer
   - Critical for detecting anomalous spending patterns

2. **`velocity_check_failed` (+0.287)**
   - Transaction velocity violations (too many transactions too quickly)
   - Strong indicator of card testing or account takeover
   - Real-time fraud prevention mechanism

3. **`location_distance` (+0.234)**
   - Distance from customer's normal geographic area
   - Indicates potential card-not-present fraud
   - Must be monitored for legitimate travel patterns

4. **`merchant_country_risk` (+0.198)**
   - Risk assessment of merchant location
   - Higher risk for international or high-risk countries
   - Balances security with legitimate international commerce

5. **`transaction_hour` (-0.156)**
   - Time of day patterns (negative = unusual timing)
   - Fraud often occurs during off-hours
   - Must account for legitimate late-night transactions

**Individual Transaction Example:**
For a $2,500 international transaction at 3 AM from 500 miles away:

- **Base fraud probability:** 0.012 (1.2% population rate)
- **Amount deviation (high):** +0.15 probability increase
- **Velocity check (failed):** +0.12 probability increase
- **Location distance (far):** +0.08 probability increase
- **International transaction:** +0.06 probability increase
- **Transaction hour (unusual):** +0.04 probability increase
- **Final fraud probability:** 0.452 (45.2% - flag for review)

### Fairness Analysis Results

**Demographic Parity Analysis:**

**Age Group Analysis:**
- **Young (18-24):** 1.2% fraud detection rate
- **Young Adult (25-34):** 1.1% fraud detection rate
- **Middle Age (35-49):** 0.9% fraud detection rate
- **Senior (50-64):** 0.8% fraud detection rate
- **Elderly (65+):** 0.7% fraud detection rate
- **Maximum difference:** 0.5% (Young vs. Elderly)
- **Conclusion:** ‚úÖ Within 2% threshold, no significant age bias

**Gender Analysis:**
- **Male:** 1.0% fraud detection rate
- **Female:** 0.9% fraud detection rate
- **Difference:** 0.1% (well within acceptable range)
- **Conclusion:** ‚úÖ No gender bias detected

**Predictive Parity Analysis:**
- **Young:** 86.2% precision (of flagged young customers, 86% actually fraudulent)
- **Middle Age:** 87.8% precision
- **Difference:** 1.6% (within acceptable range)
- **Conclusion:** ‚úÖ Consistent fraud detection accuracy across age groups

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Findings:**
1. **Model Performance**: Excellent overall accuracy with appropriate precision/recall balance
2. **Fairness Compliance**: All demographic groups within acceptable thresholds
3. **Feature Interpretability**: Clear business logic in top risk factors

**Medium Risk Findings:**
1. **False Positive Impact**: 13% false positive rate may cause customer friction
2. **Geographic Bias**: Location-based features could disadvantage rural customers
3. **International Transactions**: Higher scrutiny may impact legitimate global commerce

**Compliance Assessment:**
- **PCI DSS Compliance:** ‚úÖ PASS - Appropriate fraud monitoring implemented
- **BSA/AML Compliance:** ‚úÖ PASS - Suspicious activity detection in place
- **FCRA Accuracy:** ‚úÖ PASS - 99% accuracy meets standards
- **ECOA Compliance:** ‚úÖ PASS - No demographic discrimination detected

## Step 5: Regulatory Recommendations
