### 2. Unfair Discrimination Laws
**Primary Authority**: State Insurance Codes, NAIC Model Laws

**Key Requirements:**
- **Protected Classes**: Cannot discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or disability
- **Rate Equity**: Similar risk profiles must have similar rates
- **Justification**: Any rate differences must be actuarially justified

**GlassAlpha Mapping:**
- **Protected Attributes**: Gender, age group analysis for discrimination detection
- **Equal Opportunity**: Ensures equal treatment of qualified applicants
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal false positive/negative rates across groups
- **Bias Detection**: Automated identification of discriminatory patterns

### 3. Consumer Protection Laws
**Federal Authority**: Federal Trade Commission Act

### 4. Data Privacy Regulations
**Federal Authority**: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
**State Authority**: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act

**Key Requirements:**
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary personal information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated insurance purposes
- **Consumer Rights**: Access, deletion, portability, opt-out rights
- **Security**: Reasonable safeguards for personal information

**GlassAlpha Mapping:**
- **Protected Attributes**: Explicit handling of sensitive demographic data

### Model Validation Requirements
- [ ] **Statistical Soundness**: Validate model accuracy and reliability
- [ ] **Actuarial Justification**: Document risk factors and their relationships
- [ ] **Discrimination Testing**: Analyze for bias across protected groups
- [ ] **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test model response to input changes
- [ ] **Benchmarking**: Compare against industry standards

### Fairness and Bias Assessment
- [ ] **Protected Class Analysis**: Test for discrimination across age, gender, race, etc.
- [ ] **Proxy Discrimination**: Identify features that may proxy for protected characteristics
- [ ] **Geographic Analysis**: Ensure location factors don't create discriminatory effects
- [ ] **Socioeconomic Analysis**: Assess impact on different income groups
- [ ] **Intersectional Analysis**: Consider multiple protected characteristics together

### Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] **Technical Documentation**: Complete model specification and validation
- [ ] **Business Justification**: Clear explanation of business necessity
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation of potential harms
- [ ] **Consumer Communications**: Plain language explanations for policyholders
- [ ] **Regulatory Filings**: Prepare required state insurance department submissions

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Mitigation
1. **Feature Engineering**: Remove or transform potentially biased features
2. **Fairness Constraints**: Add fairness objectives to model training
3. **Post-Processing**: Adjust model outputs to achieve equity
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to reduce bias
5. **Regularization**: Penalize discriminatory patterns during training

### Process Mitigation
1. **Bias Testing**: Regular audits for discriminatory effects
2. **Human Oversight**: Manual review of high-impact decisions
3. **Appeals Process**: Clear procedure for challenging model decisions
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Input from diverse groups in model development
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing assessment of model performance

### Documentation Mitigation
1. **Transparency Reports**: Regular publication of model performance and bias metrics
2. **Regulatory Reporting**: Timely submission of required compliance documentation
3. **Consumer Education**: Clear explanations of how models affect policy pricing
4. **Internal Training**: Education of staff on fair insurance practices
5. **Third-Party Audits**: Independent validation of compliance measures

## Compliance Verification

### Internal Verification
- **Model Validation**: Statistical testing of model assumptions
- **Bias Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis of demographic impacts
- **Documentation Review**: Legal and compliance team review
- **Stakeholder Testing**: Business unit validation of model outputs
- **Quality Assurance**: Independent review of model implementation

### External Verification
- **Regulatory Review**: State insurance department examination
- **Actuarial Certification**: Independent actuarial opinion
- **Third-Party Audit**: External compliance assessment
- **Consumer Testing**: Real-world validation with policyholder data
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Comparison against peer institutions

## Regulatory Reporting Requirements

### Rate Filing Requirements
- **Actuarial Memorandum**: Detailed explanation of rating methodology
- **Data Sources**: Documentation of all data used in model development
- **Validation Results**: Statistical testing and performance metrics
- **Fairness Analysis**: Demonstration of non-discriminatory practices
- **Business Justification**: Clear explanation of business necessity

### Consumer Disclosure Requirements
