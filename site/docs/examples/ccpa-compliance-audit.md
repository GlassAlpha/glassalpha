# CCPA Compliance Audit Tutorial

Complete walkthrough of performing a comprehensive ML audit on an automated decision-making system using GlassAlpha. This tutorial demonstrates how to audit consumer consent prediction models for compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act and consumer rights protection.

## Overview

Businesses use machine learning models to predict consumer consent for automated decision-making and data processing activities. These models must comply with:

- **CCPA Consumer Rights**: Right to know, delete, opt-out of data sales, and non-discrimination
- **Automated Decision-Making Transparency**: Clear explanations of algorithmic decisions
- **Data Minimization**: Collection and use of only necessary personal information
- **Non-Discrimination**: Equal treatment regardless of privacy choices

### What You'll Learn

- How to configure GlassAlpha for CCPA compliance auditing
- Interpreting performance metrics for automated decision-making systems
- Understanding SHAP explanations for consumer consent transparency
- Identifying bias in automated decisions across demographic groups
- Generating regulatory-ready audit reports for California privacy compliance

### Regulatory Context

CCPA compliance requires:

- **Consumer Privacy Rights**: Right to know, access, delete, and opt-out of data sales
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Transparency and human intervention capabilities

## Step 4: Interpreting the Results

### Model Performance Analysis

**Overall Performance:**
- **Accuracy: 81.2%** - Model correctly predicts 81% of automated decision consent
- **AUC-ROC: 0.873** - Strong discriminative ability for consent prediction
- **Precision: 79.4%** - Of predicted consents, 79% are actually granted
- **Recall: 74.8%** - Model identifies 75% of all actual consent grants

**CCPA Compliance Interpretation:**
- **Consumer Rights Accuracy**: 81% accuracy supports consumer choice respect
- **False Positive Rate**: 21% of predicted consents are actually opt-outs
- **False Negative Rate**: 25% of actual consents are missed
- **Non-Discrimination**: Model respects consumer privacy choices

### SHAP Explanations

**Global Feature Importance (Top 5):**

1. **`marketing_consent_given` (+0.298)**
   - Most important CCPA compliance factor
   - Explicit marketing consent strongly predicts automated decision consent
   - Demonstrates respect for consumer privacy preferences

2. **`online_purchase_frequency` (+0.267)**
   - Purchase behavior strongly correlates with consent likelihood
   - Engaged customers more willing to consent to automated decisions
   - Indicates legitimate interest basis for processing

3. **`subscription_services` (+0.234)**
   - Subscription engagement predicts consent willingness
   - Ongoing service relationships increase consent probability
   - Supports relationship-based consent justification

4. **`tracking_cookies_accepted` (+0.198)**
   - Cookie consent status influences automated decision consent
   - Privacy-aware consumers show consistent behavior patterns
   - Important for understanding consumer privacy preferences

5. **`california_region` (+0.156)**
   - Geographic location within California affects consent patterns
   - May reflect regional privacy awareness differences
   - Requires monitoring for geographic discrimination

**Individual Consumer Example:**
For a 32-year-old consumer in Los Angeles with high engagement:

- **Base consent probability:** 0.68 (68% population average)
- **Marketing consent (given):** +0.16 probability increase
- **Online purchases (25/year):** +0.14 probability increase
- **Subscriptions (4 services):** +0.12 probability increase
- **Cookies accepted (yes):** +0.08 probability increase
- **California region (LA):** +0.04 probability increase
- **Final consent probability:** 0.92 (92% - high confidence in consent)

### Fairness Analysis Results

**Demographic Parity Analysis:**

**Age Group Consent Rates:**
- **Young (18-24):** 64.5% predicted consent rate
- **Young Adult (25-34):** 72.1% predicted consent rate
- **Middle Age (35-49):** 78.3% predicted consent rate
- **Senior (50-64):** 82.7% predicted consent rate
- **Elderly (65+):** 85.2% predicted consent rate
- **Maximum difference:** 20.7% (Young vs. Elderly)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant age-based disparities detected

**Income Bracket Analysis:**
- **Low Income:** 71.8% predicted consent rate
- **Middle Income:** 76.4% predicted consent rate
- **Upper Middle:** 79.2% predicted consent rate
- **High Income:** 81.6% predicted consent rate
- **Maximum difference:** 9.8% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Income-based disparities detected

**Predictive Parity Analysis:**
- **Young:** 71.2% precision (of flagged young consumers, 71% actually consent)
- **High Income:** 83.4% precision
- **Difference:** 12.2% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Socioeconomic accuracy disparity in consent prediction

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Findings:**

1. **Age and Income-Based Disparities**
   - 20.7% difference in consent rates across age groups
   - 9.8% difference across income brackets
   - May indicate discrimination in automated decision-making
   - Could result in CCPA non-discrimination violations

2. **Consumer Rights Impact**
   - 10% of consumers have exercised "Do Not Sell" rights
   - Model must respect these privacy choices
   - Requires enhanced transparency for automated decisions

**Medium Risk Findings:**

1. **Consent Prediction Accuracy**
   - 19% false positive rate may lead to unwanted automated decisions
   - 25% false negative rate misses consent opportunities
   - Balance needed between automation efficiency and consumer rights

**Compliance Assessment:**

- **CCPA Consumer Rights:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW - Disparities require attention
- **Automated Decision-Making:** ‚úÖ PASS - Transparency mechanisms in place
- **Non-Discrimination:** ‚ùå FAIL - Age and income bias detected
- **Data Processing Transparency:** ‚úÖ PASS - Clear data usage documentation

## Step 5: Regulatory Recommendations
