   - Important for cardiac and metabolic treatments

3. **`blood_pressure_systolic` (+0.198)**

   - Systolic blood pressure strongly influences treatment success
   - Critical vital sign for cardiovascular treatments
   - Requires careful monitoring and management

4. **`hemoglobin` (+0.156)**

   - Hemoglobin levels indicate oxygen-carrying capacity
   - Important for surgical and anemia treatments
   - Correlates with overall health status

5. **`creatinine` (+0.142)**
   - Kidney function marker
   - Critical for medication dosing and treatment planning
   - Important safety indicator for nephrotoxic treatments

**Individual Patient Example:**
For a 65-year-old patient with diabetes and hypertension:

- **Base success probability:** 0.72 (72% population average)
- **Glucose level (high):** +0.15 probability increase
- **LDL cholesterol (elevated):** +0.12 probability increase
- **Systolic BP (140):** +0.08 probability increase
- **Hemoglobin (normal):** +0.04 probability increase

- **Elderly (65-79):** 85.3% predicted success rate
- **Very Elderly (80+):** 88.7% predicted success rate
- **Maximum difference:** 14.5% (Young Adult vs. Very Elderly)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant age-based disparities detected

**Race/Ethnicity Analysis:**

- **Elderly:** 86.2% of actual successful treatments correctly identified
- **Difference:** 14.8% (exceeds 3% threshold)
- **Conclusion:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Age-based disparity in treatment success detection

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Findings:**

1. **Age-Based Treatment Disparities**

   - 14.5% difference in predicted success rates across age groups
   - May indicate age discrimination in treatment recommendations
   - Could result in suboptimal care for younger patients
   - Requires immediate clinical review and model adjustment

2. **Clinical Decision Safety**
   - 21% false positive rate may lead to overconfidence in treatment success
   - Could result in delayed alternative treatments
   - Requires validation against clinical trial data

**Medium Risk Findings:**

**Feature Correlation Concerns**

- Age strongly correlates with treatment success predictions
  - May mask underlying health status differences
  - Consider age stratification in model development

**Compliance Assessment:**

- **FDA SaMD Compliance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW - Clinical validation required
- **CLIA Standards:** ‚úÖ PASS - Laboratory value interpretation appropriate
- **HIPAA Compliance:** ‚úÖ PASS - Patient data handling compliant
- **Anti-Discrimination:** ‚ùå FAIL - Age bias detected

## Step 5: Regulatory Recommendations
