# Trust & deployment guide

This guide provides essential information about GlassAlpha's architecture, licensing, security, compliance, and deployment to help organizations evaluate and confidently adopt the tool.

## Architecture & design

### Built for enterprise reliability

GlassAlpha uses a **plugin-based architecture** designed for extensibility and reliability:

- **Component Registration**: Models, explainers, and metrics register themselves dynamically
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML configuration files control all behavior deterministically
- **Protocol-Based Interfaces**: Clean separation of concerns with type-safe interfaces
- **Audit Trail Integration**: Every decision and component selection is logged for reproducibility

### System flow

```
User Configuration → Component Selection → Data Processing →
Model Loading → Explanation Generation → Metrics Computation →
PDF Report Generation → Audit Manifest Creation
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Deterministic Outputs**: Same configuration = identical results
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new model types and explainers
- **Enterprise Ready**: Clear separation between OSS and commercial features

## Licensing & dependencies

### Open source foundation

- **Core License**: Apache 2.0 - Full commercial use permitted
- **No GPL Dependencies**: Carefully curated stack avoids license contamination
- **Enterprise Compatible**: Compatible with corporate licensing requirements

### Technology stack confidence

| Component        | License    | Purpose         | Enterprise Ready     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| **Python SHAP**  | MIT        | Explanations    | ✅ No GPL issues     |
| **XGBoost**      | Apache 2.0 | Tree models     | ✅ Compatible family |
| **scikit-learn** | BSD        | Baseline models | ✅ Academic standard |
| **WeasyPrint**   | BSD        | PDF generation  | ✅ Pure Python       |

**Licensing Benefits:**

- **Commercial Use**: No restrictions on internal or external use
- **Integration Ready**: Compatible with proprietary systems
- **Container Friendly**: Works in Docker/Kubernetes without conflicts
- **Audit Compliant**: Full source transparency for regulatory review

## Security & privacy

### Security-first design

- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your infrastructure
- **No Data Transmission**: Your data never leaves your environment
- **Privacy by Default**: No telemetry collection (opt-in only)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking without storing sensitive data

### Enterprise security features

- **File-Based Storage**: No persistent databases required
- **Memory Cleanup**: Sensitive data cleared after processing
- **Reproducible Security**: All operations are deterministic and auditable
- **Air-Gap Compatible**: Full offline operation capability

### Security reporting

- **Vulnerability Reports**: security@glassalpha.com
- **Response Time**: 48-hour acknowledgment target
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Coordinated vulnerability handling

## Regulatory compliance

### Supported frameworks

GlassAlpha addresses key regulatory requirements:

**EU GDPR (Article 22)**

- Right to explanation for automated decisions
- Data protection and consent requirements

**US Fair Lending (ECOA/FCRA)**

- Non-discrimination in credit decisions
- Accuracy and fairness in reporting

**EU AI Act (2024)**

- Risk classification and transparency
- Human oversight and quality management

### Compliance features

- **Deterministic Audits**: Reproducible results for regulatory verification
- **Complete Lineage**: Full audit trails with cryptographic hashes
- **Professional Reports**: Publication-quality documentation
- **Fairness Metrics**: Demographic parity and equal opportunity analysis

## Deployment & production

### Deployment options

**Local Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlassAlpha/glassalpha
cd glassalpha/packages
pip install -e .
```

**Container Deployment**

- Compatible with Docker and Kubernetes
- No external dependencies required
- Works in air-gapped environments

**CI/CD Integration**

- Automated builds with locked dependency versions
- Reproducible installation across environments
- Git-based version control integration

### Production considerations

**Performance**

- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing for large datasets
- **Fast Execution**: Under 60 seconds for typical audits
- **Scalable**: Parallel processing support

**Monitoring & Maintenance**

- **Version Pinning**: Locked dependencies for reproducibility
- **Update Strategy**: Clear migration paths between versions
- **Support Model**: Community support with enterprise options
