# Changelog Maintenance

## Standards
- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for version numbers
- Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest first)

## Categories (Use These Sections)
- **Added** - New features
- **Changed** - Changes in existing functionality  
- **Deprecated** - Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** - Now removed features
- **Fixed** - Bug fixes
- **Security** - Security vulnerabilities
- **In Development** - Features being worked on (pre-release only)
- **Documentation** - Doc-only changes

## Phase 1 Specific Rules
- Be honest about development status - use "In Development" for unimplemented features
- Focus on audit-first priorities: PDF generation, determinism, fairness metrics
- Don't promise features outside Phase 1 scope
- Include "No releases yet" until first actual release

## Entry Format

Use this format for changelog entries:

```
### Added
- TreeSHAP explanations for XGBoost models with deterministic output
- CLI command `glassalpha audit --config file.yaml --out report.pdf`
```

## When to Update
- Before each release (move Unreleased â†’ version number)
- When merging significant PRs
- When changing user-facing behavior
- When fixing security issues (immediate update required)

## Regulatory Context
- Changes must be trackable for audit purposes
- Include impact on determinism/reproducibility
- Note any breaking changes to audit outputs
