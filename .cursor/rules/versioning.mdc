# Run manifests
- Every CLI run writes `manifest.json` with: git SHA, package version, config hash, dataset hash, seeds, start/end timestamps (UTC).

# Hashing
- Dataset hash: SHA256 of canonicalized CSV/Parquet (schema + content).

# Versioning
- Semantic versioning; keep `_version.py` as the single source of truth.
