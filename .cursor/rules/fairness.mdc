# Metrics & thresholds
- Implement core group metrics: demographic parity, equalized odds, TPR/FPR gaps, calibration by group.
- Drift: PSI/KL/KS per feature; flag top-k drifts.
- Thresholds come from YAML config; each metric returns pass/fail + margin.

# Reporting
- Show confidence intervals or bootstrap error for fairness metrics.
- Clearly state **protected attributes** and any exclusions.
