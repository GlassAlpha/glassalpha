Fairness and drift rules

# Phase 1 Scope (Current Focus)
**Note:** This rule is scoped for Phase 1. Advanced monitoring and continuous drift detection are deferred.

# Basic Metrics for Audit Report
- Implement core group metrics for PDF audit: demographic parity, equalized odds, TPR/FPR gaps, calibration by group
- Basic drift detection: PSI/KL/KS per feature (static comparison only, no continuous monitoring)
- Thresholds come from YAML config; each metric returns pass/fail + margin for audit report

# Reporting
- Show confidence intervals or bootstrap error for fairness metrics in PDF
- Clearly state **protected attributes** and any exclusions
- Flag top-k feature drifts in audit report
