# Docs
- README must show: 3-line value prop, install, **60s "Hello Audit" example**.
- Quickstart must produce a PDF in <60s on German Credit.
- Examples must cover: credit (German/HELOC), bias (COMPAS), drift (Adult Income).

# OSS posture
- License: **Apache-2.0** for core library.
- Add CONTRIBUTING, Code of Conduct, SECURITY policy, Changelog, and **Assumptions & Limitations** page.

# MkDocs Site Structure
- Site lives in `site/` directory with `mkdocs.yml` at `site/mkdocs.yml`
- MkDocs dependencies in `site/requirements.txt`, NOT at repo root
- Content in `site/docs/`, examples in `examples/`
- CI must run `cd site && mkdocs build`, NOT `mkdocs build` from repo root
- All example notebooks must be runnable and produce expected outputs
- Enable spellcheck but allow technical terms in `known_words.txt`

# Content Quality
- Every feature must have both API docs and example notebook
- Blog posts go in `site/docs/blog/posts/` with proper frontmatter
- Include proper meta descriptions for SEO
