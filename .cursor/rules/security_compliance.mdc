Security, privacy, and on-prem practices

# Phase 1 Scope (Local CLI Only)
**Note:** This rule is scoped for Phase 1 local CLI usage. Container/enterprise deployment features are deferred.

# Data handling
- No PII logging in core library
- Provide a redaction utility for logs and reports  
- Support full offline mode; telemetry disabled by default
- All operations must work without network calls

# Local Security Practices
- Never log raw PII; sanitize and hash IDs
- Store configs and outputs with appropriate file permissions
- Support air-gapped environments by default
- Gate any telemetry behind explicit env flag: `GLASSALPHA_TELEMETRY=on` (default off)
