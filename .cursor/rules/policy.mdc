Policy-as-code for recourse and compliance

# Phase 1 Scope (Minimal Recourse POC)
**Note:** This rule is scoped for Phase 1 minimal recourse. Advanced policy features are deferred.

# Basic Policy Schema
- Define simple constraints in YAML (validated on load):
  - Immutable features (cannot be changed)
  - Monotonic constraints (e.g., age can only increase)
  - Basic cost function (simple weights per feature)
- Refuse to run recourse if policy invalid

# Minimal Recourse Implementation
- Each suggestion includes:
  - Changed fields with their deltas
  - Total cost based on simple cost function
  - Verification that constraints are satisfied
  - Policy version for reproducibility
