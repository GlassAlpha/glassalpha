# Policy schema
- Define immutables, monotone fields, bounds, cost weights, and allowed actions in YAML (validated on load).
- Refuse to run recourse if policy invalid.

# Recourse guarantees
- Each suggestion includes: changed fields, costs, feasibility proof, predicted delta, and **policy version**.
