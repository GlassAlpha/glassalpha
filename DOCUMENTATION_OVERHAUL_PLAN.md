# GlassAlpha Documentation Overhaul Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Outdated Status**: All documentation shows "Pre-Alpha" and "Coming Soon" when system is production-ready
2. **Incorrect Information**: Command examples, feature lists, and capabilities don't match implemented functionality
3. **Missing User Documentation**: No actual usage guides for the working system
4. **Scattered Information**: Critical information buried in development files rather than user documentation
5. **Inconsistent Messaging**: Mixed messages about what works vs. what's planned

### Documentation Audit Results:

**Files Requiring Major Updates:**
- `/README.md` - Still shows pre-alpha status, wrong command syntax
- `/packages/README.md` - Outdated architecture description, wrong feature status
- `/site/docs/index.md` - Completely outdated, shows everything as "planned"
- `/site/docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` - No actual usage instructions
- All example documentation shows non-working commands

**Missing Critical Documentation:**
- Working quickstart tutorial
- CLI reference for actual commands
- Configuration schema documentation
- Real usage examples with German Credit dataset
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- API reference documentation

**Development Artifacts Cluttering Documentation:**
- Demo files (demo_*.py) in main directory
- CI-specific documentation mixed with user docs
- Test PDFs and development notes in public view
- Development status files that should be internal

## Documentation Strategy

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Immediate Credibility**: Remove all outdated status warnings that undermine trust
2. **User-Focused Content**: Create documentation that helps users accomplish tasks
3. **Professional Presentation**: Maintain compliance tool standards for trustworthiness
4. **Clear Information Architecture**: Logical organization from basic to advanced topics

### Content Hierarchy:
1. **Quick Start** (Get running in 5 minutes)
2. **Tutorial** (German Credit audit walkthrough)
3. **Reference** (CLI commands, configuration schema, API)
4. **Advanced** (Compliance frameworks, deployment, troubleshooting)

### Style Guidelines:
- Professional, trustworthy tone (no emojis)
- Actionable instructions with clear outcomes
- Honest about limitations and requirements
- Concise but complete information
- Focus on business value and compliance benefits

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Status Updates (Immediate)
Remove all misleading status information that suggests the system doesn't work when it actually does. This is critical for credibility.

### Phase 2: Core User Documentation (Priority)
Create the essential documentation users need to successfully use the system:
- Installation and setup
- First audit generation
- Configuration guidance
- Common troubleshooting

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Reference (Important)
Build complete reference materials:
- Full CLI documentation
- Configuration schema reference
- API documentation
- Advanced usage examples

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Valuable)
Add specialized documentation for advanced users:
- Compliance framework mapping
- Production deployment
- Custom integrations
- Troubleshooting complex scenarios

## Success Criteria

**Immediate Success (Phase 1):**
- No outdated status warnings anywhere in public documentation
- All command examples use correct, working syntax
- Feature lists accurately reflect implemented capabilities

**User Success (Phase 2):**
- New user can install and generate first audit within 10 minutes
- Clear path from installation to production use
- Common questions answered before users need to ask

**Long-term Success (Phases 3-4):**
- Documentation quality exceeds other compliance tools
- Comprehensive coverage of all system capabilities
- Supports both simple and advanced use cases

## Quality Standards

### Content Quality:
- Every example must work exactly as shown
- Every command must be tested and verified
- Every configuration example must be valid
- All links must resolve correctly

### Professional Standards:
- Language appropriate for compliance/regulatory context
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Honest about limitations and requirements
- Focused on business value and outcomes

### User Experience:
- Information organized by user intent, not system structure
- Progressive disclosure from simple to complex
- Cross-references between related topics
- Searchable and scannable content

This plan prioritizes credibility and user success while building toward comprehensive, professional-grade documentation suitable for a compliance tool.
