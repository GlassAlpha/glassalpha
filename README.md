# GlassAlpha

**Open-source AI compliance toolkit for transparent, auditable, and regulator-ready ML models.**

## Why GlassAlpha?

As AI regulations tighten globally (EU AI Act, CFPB guidance), organizations need **transparent, auditable ML systems**. Most existing audit tools are either academic research code, enterprise SaaS platforms with vendor lock-in, or custom internal tools that lack reproducibility.

GlassAlpha provides **deterministic, regulator-ready audit reports** with complete lineage tracking. Run the same config twice, get byte-identical PDFs. Every decision is explainable, every metric is reproducible, every audit trail is complete.

**Why Open Source**: Compliance tools require trust. Open source code means regulators, auditors, and your team can verify exactly how conclusions were reached.

## Status & Scope

**Production Features**:
- âœ… One-command PDF audit generation
- âœ… XGBoost, LightGBM, LogisticRegression support
- âœ… TreeSHAP explainability + fairness metrics
- âœ… Deterministic, reproducible outputs
- âœ… Apache 2.0 license with optional Enterprise extensions

## Quick Start

## Project Structure

- **`packages/`**: Core Python package ([detailed README](packages/README.md))
  - Plugin architecture with OSS/Enterprise separation
  - Protocol-based interfaces for extensibility
  - Deterministic component selection
- **`site/`**: Documentation (MkDocs)
- **`configs/`**: Example audit configurations

## Architecture Highlights

GlassAlpha is built as an **extensible framework**:
- **Plugin Architecture**: Models, explainers, and metrics use dynamic registration
- **OSS/Enterprise Split**: Core functionality open-source, advanced features commercial
- **Deterministic Design**: Configuration-driven with reproducible results
- **Audit Profiles**: Different compliance contexts use appropriate component sets

For detailed architecture information, see the [Architecture Guide](site/docs/architecture.md).
