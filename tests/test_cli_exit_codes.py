"""CLI exit code contract tests.

These tests verify that specific exit codes are returned for different error
conditions, enabling reliable CI/CD integration and GitHub Action workflows.

Exit Code Schema:
    0: Success - Command completed successfully
    1: User Error - Configuration issues, missing files, invalid inputs
    2: System Error - Permissions, resources, environment issues
    3: Validation Error - Strict mode or validation failures
